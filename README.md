## Inspiration
**Fellow Stories** aims to build an exclusive community around MLH Fellows and their interests, experiences and stories. It provides a single platform to all the MLH Fellows to post their blogs so that they can target and engage more readership from the audience that wants to explore more about the fellowship and the fellows. Only the users authorized by the admin i.e. the official MLH Fellows will be allowed to post on the platform, hence, this will act as an authentic source for insights and details about the fellowship. 

> ### Explore, Connect, Follow and more!

## How we built it

- **Frontend**: Docusaurus, React 
- **Backend**: NodeJS
- **IDE**: VS Code
- **Design**: Figma
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Web Hosting**: Netlify, Heroku

## What it does
- **Single Platform** for all MLH Fellowship Stories & Experiences
- Helps MLH Fellows pinpoint and gain an audience
- Easy to track discussions and reader engagement for the fellowship
- Interactive Dashboard with latest stats about posts
- Easy search functionality

## Challenges we ran into

  1. All of us are new to Docusaurus, took us sometime to explore it.
  2. Integrating backend to frontend is always time consuming, so that's one challenge.
  3. Time management was really challenging since it's only the beginning of the fellowship
  4. Working in different timezones was quite a task :P
  
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

  1. Fellow Stories is one of it's kind, exclusively for the MLH Fellows, by the MLH Fellows
  2. Fellows now have a dedicated platform for all their stories and experiences
  3. This would bring the community closer, and help it expand even more
  4. This would help in setting up a dedicated readership for the fellowship

## What we learned
  1. It was really interesting for us to explore Docusaurus. We were all new to this, thus took a while to explore and understand how things work within Docusaurus before actually starting to code. 
  2. We all went through rigorous meetings and discussions in this phase, which helped us in understanding more about collaboration to an open source project.
  3. We learned and implemented open source best practices like- making use of GitHub project board, setting up branch protection rules, adding Issue/PR templates, and following a consistent style for writing commit messages etc.
  4. We made use of some GitHub bots like - Welcome Bot, Stale Bot, Gitpod etc so as to speed collaboration and project management.
